At times like this, we “reject” the contract.  Then we mail a copy back to the vendor for a signature and a payment amount.  Once the signed contract is received for DCPS, we must fax in the signed request into DCPS.  The signed contract will now show in “New” status.  We can go in and certify and pay the contract.  However, the payment is defaulting to $0.00 instead of $15.00.  as a result payment files are going for payment for $0.00.  DCM 447  See attached

Steps:


1.	CPO will update the DDE status to Incomplete so that the users will know that the content of the DDE is unofficial
2.	SAM will ask the user to do the following:
a.	Go to DCPS “DDS All Assigned” queue to transfer the case out to the FO
b.	Go to eView or contact the FO to delete the three documents from the Case Documents tab (831, DDE, CDW)
c.	The user should expect to see the 3200 transaction to fail and appear in the “Transaction failure queue” because the claim is already closed in NDDSS.  The user should dismiss it from the transaction failure queue.
d.	After the user clicks the “Transfer” button, notify the SAM so that the SAM can let CPO know to proceed to the next step
3.	CPO will now update the case status to close and close out existing todos (like the normal closure process).  Once this is done, the user will see the case in the “Closed Case Queue” as “Transfer”.
4.	BI should also show this case as Transfer
5.	CPO inform SAM to verify with the user step #3.
6.	SAM will ask the user to clean up NDDSS:
a.	The user should either contact the EFI team to update the NDDSS status to ND, or manually open/close the case in NDDSS again as ND"

Tech has researched this issue. Jason Higdon’s response below:


I see an entry for this case in casedoc table for both the 10th and the 14th of August both for DCM4169

I also see correlating ”UREV” todo entries (aka unread todo entries) for them on the 10th and 14th

Both of these todo items are marked as completed.

The one from the 10th was marked completed on 2017-08-11 13:26:40 by PIN 073579 (Rebecca Philbrick)


The system seems to be acting as designed and did propagate an Unread Evidence item on the dashboard that was completed by the examiner. Please let us know if there is anything else."

I have been working on claim 1673. I moved from FOFAE to Impairment Severity/Sign page without difficulty and worked on 416. 
When I finished 416 and clicked Save and Continue button, it would not do anything. I copied and pasted 416 to Word and then, I clicked Save 416 – it did not save (no green box). I clicked Sign and Save 416 – nothing happened. I clicked Back to DDE – it asked me if I was going to go back to DDE without saving – when I said yes, it went back to Impairment page but 416 was gone. I went back into 416 and pasted everything back on, clicked every button for save function – nothing happened. Back to DDE button was the only thing working.
During this time, I didn’t get any error message at all. I had to refresh DCPS and then it is now working normally.

It appears the FO created a barcode for an 827 and then moved the barcode page only to section C (Temporary – Green) in eView.  There are two other 827s that are correct in section E, but because the incorrect one in section C is a later date (9/29/17) this is pulling in with the vendor MER requests and is only the barcode page, not the actual release.  An 827 in the green section C should not be pulling into MER or CE requests.

Good morning Marianne and Cheryl,
The CPO has analyzed IM11039973 and created Story #D-02244 in Version One for tracking purposes. The story is planned to be included as part of Release 0.93.1 on November 18, 2017.
As a reminder, the CPO’s process for closing CAPRS is to do so once a defect or story has been created in Version One. As a result, we are requesting your agreement in closing this CAPRS. Please confirm your agreement to this, or let us know of any additional concerns or questions."

The FO reactivated the claim (reason “NH Filing a new claim”) and the claim loaded directly into DCPS.  A couple oddities exist:  1 – it is showing as 73 days old with an assignment date of 7/21.  2 – it is showing as a concurrent claim with a filing date of 9/28 in eVIEW.

Our DCPS staff discussed and decided to reject this case back to the FO and ask them to load a new claim instead so it could be processed in legacy.  However, even though Case Control staff did reject the claim from the Pre-Receipt queue and this ‘new’ claim was never receipted or assigned, it is listed in the ‘DDS Assigned’ category.  

Case Activity shows no new activity regarding the reactivation or any DCPS activity.  

How can we get rid of this claim?

Good morning Tony and Angie,
The CPO has analyzed IM11043000 and created stories S-15420, S-15341, and S-15324 in Version One for tracking purposes. S-15420 is planned to be a part of the 93.1 release while the other stories are planned for the 1.0 release.
As a reminder, the CPO’s process for closing CAPRS is to do so once a defect or story has been created in Version One. As a result, we are requesting your agreement in closing this CAPRS. Please confirm your agreement to this, or let us know of any additional concerns or questions.
Thank you,

Marianne,

You opened the CAPRS below related to T0128 transaction failures in DCPS. Those are happening in relation to Trailer Mail. When Trailer mail is received, DCPS attempts to send  T0128 but it is failing as you no longer have jurisdiction. We are working to not send T0128 on closed cases. You may just dismiss the transaction failures. No further action is needed on your part.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

The CPO has analyzed IM11045537 and created stories #S-15492 and S-15490 in Version One for tracking purposes.
As a reminder, the CPO’s process for closing CAPRS is to do so once a defect or story has been created in Version One. As a result, we are requesting your agreement in closing this CAPRS. Please confirm your agreement to this, or let us know of any additional concerns or questions.
If you do not want to close the ticket at this time, we can suspend the ticket until after the release.  Please let us know which you would prefer.

Here is the problem. the FO scanned in MER using an 827 barcode page.  Nothing we do can correct the 827.  We tried uncategorized the document, moving it to the Green section etc.  then if you create a mer request, the mer will print with the request in place of the 827.

Look at the following cases as listed on the problem template:  2156, 2157 and 3016.

We looked into the triple that failed closure in DCPS for IM11054146. The CDBR claim in this case is an escalated claim. DCPS does not currently support escalated claims. Our closure process is trying to close this claim as an Initial claim instead of a Recon claim. You will need to transfer the case to the legacy system and close it there."

Transaction failures, type 0128, error reason 098.We currently have 8 of these errors. I thought we were told that these happen with trailer mail comes in on a closed DCPS case, and that we could just dismiss the error. I checked some of these and found no records were received on the date of the failure. Does this mean we are missing the records, or were they received long before the error? We need clarification on these transaction failures.
*Describe the Business Impact on Users:
The business impact is, we will eventually receive bills for these medical records. If we didn’t actually receive them, we will have an issue with our vendors. (if we can’t see the records, we won’t pay for them)

Good Morning!

I spoke to Margie in WA and she states to please close the ticket. This was her error as she was looking for actual medical and not a claimant form that was actually received.

“I’ve done some checking and included adjudicators and found out that the trailer mail wasn’t medical records, it was case forms sent back from the claimant. I’m so sorry I made you all research this as a potential problem. I was strictly concentrating on medical records when I should have been looking elsewhere in EView for anything received the day before or day of the transaction failure. Thank you for your help, I appreciate it. (there are a lot of areas where we haven’t “learned” the ins and outs and different terminology, etc.)”"

It took approximately 40 seconds for the dashboard to open and for the MER Payment Requests to load.  There is also slowness with searching within both the fiscal dashboard and case control all assigned queue. You cannot type a full word and search as it stops to search after each individual letter (and there is a delay between each letter). **Ohio has also confirmed this issue.
